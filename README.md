# What is this?

This is a template designed to be used for any new project to be created.

It skips the CRA boiler-plate by only adding the packages I use when designing web applications with React, this template by default uses **typescript, tailwind, framer-motion** and **LESS**.

This is only a fairly new package so I haven't used it for many projects yet; when needed i'll be adding necessary packages.


Start the project by running `git clone https://github.com/rebecca-davies/react.git` followed by `npm start` inside of the project folder.
